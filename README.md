## Problem Formulation
Given that concrete layers were securely computed, generate abstract conjugate layers and then invoke generation of abstract domain given coordinate points in latent space given classification output states iterating over defined `epochs` to generate robustness region to evaluate the deductive analysis of robustness. This is not exactly robust to the extent of other designs, but a general experiment with setting up more rigorous designs for abstract interpretation.
