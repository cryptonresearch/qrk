Abstract Interpretation of Differentiable, Private Convolutional Network Layers with Conditional Affine Transformations and Abstract Domains

## Problem Formulation
Given that concrete layers were securely computed, generate abstract conjugate layers and then invoke generation of abstract domain given coordinate points in latent space given classification output states iterating over defined `epochs` to generate robustness region to evaluate the deductive analysis of robustness. This is not exactly robust to the extent of other designs, but a general experiment with setting up more rigorous designs for abstract interpretation.

## Introduction
- We address the challenge of sound verification by leveraging the well-developed framework of abstract interpretation (Cousot, 1977), a theory for approximating a potentially infinite set of behaviors with a finite representation with sound over-approximation and bounded numeric & abstract domains and transformers. 

## Preliminaries
- Abstract interpretation theory [POPL â€™77, 79, JLC 92] formalizes the idea of abstraction for mathematical constructs involved in the specification of properties of computer systems.
